Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of infrastructure engineering](https://infrastructure.eng.unimelb.edu.au) at [the University of Melbourne](https://unimelb.edu.au). My research focuses on the effects of prolonged drought on hydrological systems and the reliabilitity of hydrological models and is partially funded through the [Australian Research Council](https://www.arc.gov.au/)'s [Linkage Project LP180100796: *Observed streamflow generation changes: better understanding and modelling*]( https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/project/104526-observed-streamflow-generation-changes--better-understanding-and-modelling)

Before landing in Melbourne, I earned my M.Sc. in [Industrial Ecology](https://is4ie.org/about/what-is-industrial-ecology) from [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en) and [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) and my B.Eng. in Environmental Engineering from the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en).
